# Analysis of Voter Registration Trends in Relation to Marriage and Divorce Rates by State in 2020 vs 2000

# Project Overview
This project explores the potential correlations between voter registration trends and marital status dynamics across different states in the United States. By analyzing marriage rates, divorce rates, and voter registration figures, this study aims to uncover the impact of marital status on civic participation. The project seeks to answer key questions about the relationship between marital status and voter registration patterns, variations across states, and the factors driving these trends.

# Purpose
The primary objective is to identify if marital status significantly influences voter registration, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of civic engagement across the United States. This analysis provides insights into how demographic factors like marriage and divorce rates may affect political participation.

Data Sources
This project utilized authoritative and reliable data sources to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the analysis on voter registration trends in relation to marriage and divorce rates across different states in the United States for the years 2000 and 2020. Below are the specific sources of our data:

Voter Registration Data:

Federal Election Commission (FEC): Provides comprehensive information on election results and voting, including detailed data for the federal elections of 2020. This data was instrumental in analyzing voter registration trends across states.
Election Results and Voting Information - Federal Elections 2020: https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/election-results-and-voting-information/federal-elections-2020/

Marriage Rates Data:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Offers detailed statistics on marriage rates by state, capturing the dynamics of marital status from 1990 to 2020. This longitudinal data provided a basis for examining changes in marriage rates over time.

Divorce Rates Data:

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Similarly, provides detailed statistics on divorce rates by state, allowing for a comparative analysis with marriage rates and voter registration trends.
State Divorce Rates 90-95-99-20 (PDF): https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/state-divorce-rates-90-95-99-20.pdf

These sources were critical in conducting a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between marriage, divorce, and voter registration trends. By leveraging data from the FEC and CDC, this project ensures a high level of reliability and relevance in its findings.
